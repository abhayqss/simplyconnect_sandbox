/******** Setup Node.js Server as a window service *********/

1) Install qckwinsvc, "npm install -g qckwinsvc"
2) Open command line interface with administrator privileges, go to the project root directory and type "qckwinsvc"
3) It will ask few parameters
	a) Service name (Name of the sevice that will display on service list)
	b) Service description (Some description of the service)
	c) Node script path (Path of the entry point of Nodejs project)
	d) Should the service get started immediately? (y/n) ('y' to start service automatically on window start)
4) After all these parameters, qckwinsvc will install and start your service.
5) You can see your service name in the list of all windows services.


Note:
  In case after all successfull steps, your service is still not visible in windows service list, then
	a) Go to the project root directory (on the path where you type "qckwinsvc" command via command line).
	b) you will see a folder "daemon", which contain .exe file generated by "qckwinsvc"
	c) Now, open command line interface with administrator privileges, and create a window service using following command
		"sc create 'serviceName' binpath= 'absolute path to your node.js project entry file' start= auto".
	d) This command will create new window service and you can see it in windows service list.
