As a service coordinator, you play an essential and important role in this engagement process.</p><p class=\"guide__no-instruction-text\">Keep in mind that the SeniorConnect assessment tool is not a scoring instrument or an algorithm that produces a \"score\" or defines specific interventions or actions. It is designed to help you learn more about the senior as you apply your professional knowledge, experience, and critical thinking skills to develop a service plan that connects the senior to services
